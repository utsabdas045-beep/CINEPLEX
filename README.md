# CINEPLEX
Cineplex is a Netflix-inspired frontend website built using only HTML and CSS. It features a clean, responsive UI with a hero section, background video, custom logo, and movie-style layouts. The project focuses on layout, styling, and design fundamentals, making it ideal for UI cloning, portfolios, and academic submissions.
